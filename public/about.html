    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Wiktor Bonderek and I am an aspiring web-developer. I currently
      work at a company providing SaaS software for online stores as Product
      Owner of the UX/UI team.
    </p>

    <p>
      I took my first steps with code in 2021, participating in a Frontend
      programming track organized by my employer. I have completed basic web
      development training and am constantly expanding my competencies by
      learning more and more new technologies.
